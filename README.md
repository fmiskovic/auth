# Auth Library

This Go library provides authentication middleware and utilities for handling JWT tokens. 
It includes functionality for validating tokens, extracting claims, and managing user context.
If the given token is valid, it extracts the claims and adds them to the request context.

## Installation

To install the library, use `go get`:
